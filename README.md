3 months ago Garann Means from Austin, TX made this Amazing Magical Template-Engine-Chooser tool.
3 weeks ago I knew about it in JavaScrit Weekly Issue #76.
Now I remade this great piece of information in a more informative way.
If you see that I''m wrong and you suppose that you know word informative better - you''re welcome to fork and rework again.
