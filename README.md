# Long story short
3 months ago Garann Means from Austin, TX made this Amazing Magical Template-Engine-Chooser tool.

3 weeks ago I knew about it in JavaScrit Weekly Issue #76. And I figured, that here it is - valuable piece of information presented like a total mess.

Now I remade this great piece of information in a more informative and convinient way - in an old plain table.

# You are always welcome 
If you see that I''m wrong and you suppose that you know word informative better - you''re welcome to fork and rework again.

# Acknoledgements
* Garann Means for the informations that is presented in this table
* Marcus Kazmierczak for the post "Infographic design, give tables a chance"
