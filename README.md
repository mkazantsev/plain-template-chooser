# Long story short
3 months ago [Garann Means](http://garann.com/) from Austin, TX made this [Amazing Magical Template-Engine-Chooser tool](http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/).

3 weeks ago I've read about it in [JavaScript Weekly Issue #76](http://javascriptweekly.com/archive/76.html). And I figured, that here it is - a valuable piece of information,  presented like a total mess.

Now I've remade this great piece of information in a more informative and convinient way - as an old plain table.

# You are always welcome
If you see that I'm wrong and you suppose that you know information presentation better - you're welcome to fork and rework again.

# Acknoledgements
* [Garann Means](https://github.com/garann) for all the information that is presented in this table.
* [Marcus Kazmierczak](http://mkaz.com/) (he squatted nickname mkaz on GitHub earlier than me) for the post ["Infographic design, give tables a chance"](http://mkaz.com/dataviz/infographic-design.html).
